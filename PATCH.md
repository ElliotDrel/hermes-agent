# Maintained Hermes changes

Base: official stable v2026.9.24, f97608f178d1ffeca59860195ab7da295f7c8e5f.
`main` stays exact official stable. The gateway runs `live`, which carries only
the entries below. Rebase these commits on each stable release; audit their intent
even when Git reports no conflicts. Prior customizations remain on backup branches
and are not part of this running version.

## HERMES-FORK-023: Native Windows update drain

Windows updates use the normal restart exit budget, including its after-turn wait.
The socket pause is attempted before the planned-stop marker; the marker is only
the fallback when no valid ACK arrives. Otherwise the marker invokes direct stop
and bypasses normal agent draining. The existing drain reporter shows active work
while waiting. Native timeout, forced-stop fallback, install and restart remain native.

Touchpoints: hermes_cli/update_cmd_windows.py. No gateway turn-loop changes.
Verification: test_windows_update_drain.py initially failed for the short deadline
and missing reports; socket-first regression initially observed marker-before-socket.
Final focused/adjacent Windows suite: 43 passed. Tests simulate process lifecycle;
they do not kill a live agent. Upstream candidate bug fixes, not a replacement updater.
